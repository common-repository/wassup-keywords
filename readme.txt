Datamines your Wassup stats database for visitor search engine keywords and provides a ranked list.

== Description ==

Ever wanted to know what actual keyword phrases are bringing visitors to your site?

Well, this information is recorded by the Wassup visitor plugin, which is cool...
However, it doesn't actually give you a way of listing the keywords together, it just shows 
you a long list of detailed visitor stats, so I put this little addon page module together to 
datamine your Wassup database and show a ranked list of your keywords and which search engines
they came from. (Obviously you need Wassup installed.)

You can also check your Google rankings for any of the keywords with the click of a button
if they came from Google. A neat little way of seeing which keyword phrases are working for
you so you can optimize your blog and posts for them even more, as even a slight change in 
your ranking for a phrase can bring in extra traffic.

1. Upload 'wassupkeywords.php' to the '/wp-content/plugins/wassup-keywords/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
